# 2.0 Description

The Web-App is built using Streamlit library and helps to generate Caption/Summary from Input Image. The training python notebook has the code to train the LSTM model and save it using pickle library and the app.py python file contains the Web-App code where user can enter any image and get the Caption/Summary of it within seconds.

Number of Images in Dataset = 8091
Model used for Extracting features from Image = VGG16
Model used for Training the features with words = LSTM using Keras

Area of Improvement - The input dataset can have more images so the LSTM model can have multiple choices.
